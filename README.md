# Pluvia-for-the-Terminal
bash script for linux
<br><br>
It plays 3 layered "flac" sound files to create a very nice rainy sound indefinitely until "CTRL-C" is pressed at any time.
<br><br>
install "ffmpeg" first:
<br><br>
"apt-get install ffmpeg"
<br><br>
To run:
<br><br>
"bash Pluvia.sh"
<br><br>
Thank you!
